# Installation instructions (For musicians/bands)
These instructons will show you how to set up your own version of this project that you can start adding your own music to. Here, I'll assume you don't have a working knowledge of web development and you simply want to get your own site setup.

1. Create a Netlify account.
Netlify is a free hosting service that allows you to host your own websites. It allows you to host, for free, your own version of this project along with a CMS that you can use to add your own stuff to.

2. Create a GitHub account.
Create an account on this site. This is where you will keep your own version of this project and where your band's stuff will be kept. (Although this original repository is public, your can be private if you want. We'll get to that later.)

3. Fork this repo......
4. Create site on Netlify
5. Enable identity and git gateway
6. Add your band's stuff to the CMS
