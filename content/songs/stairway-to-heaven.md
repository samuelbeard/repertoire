  # Verse 1
            Am         E+ *
  There’s a lady who’s sure
          C           D
  All that glitters is gold
            F                    G  Am
  And she’s buying a stairway to heaven.
          Am             E+ *
  When she gets there she knows
        C              D
  If the stores are all closed

        F                         G    Am
  With a word she can get what she came for.
  C    D    F    Am            C        G              D
  Ooh, ooh, Ooh, ooh and she’s buying a stairway to heaven.

  

            Am          E+ *
  There’s a sign on the wall
          C           D
  But she wants to be sure
            F                             G   Am
  cause you know sometimes words have two meanings.
      Am          E+ *
  In a tree by the brook
            C            D
  There’s a songbird who sings,
            F                       G  Am
  Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven.

  Am E+ C D F G Am

  D                Am    Em D C D
  Ooh, it makes me wonder,
  D  Dsus4 D                Am    Em D C D
  Ooh,      and it makes me wonder.

            C         G
  There’s a feeling I get
        Am
  When I look to the west,
        C         G          F   Am
  And my spirit is crying for leaving.
        C               G
  In my thoughts I have seen
          Am
  Rings of smoke through the trees,
          C         G               F   Am
  And the voices of those who stand looking.

  C G Am

  D                Am    Em D C D
  Ooh, it makes me wonder,
  D  Dsus4 D                Am    Em D C D
  Ooh,      and it makes me wonder.

          C              G
  And its whispered that soon
        Am
  If we all call the tune
          C          G          F   Am
  Then the piper will lead us to reason.
        C            G
  And a new day will dawn
      Am
  For those who stand long
          C            G         F    Am
  And the forests will echo with laughter.

  C G Am

  Am D   Am  Em D C D

  Am
  Ooooh

  D        Am   Em D C D
  Oooooooh

  C            G              Am
  If there’s a bustle in your hedgerow
          G
  Don’t be alarmed now,
  C           G                    Am
  It’s just a spring clean for the may queen.
  C              G                 Am
  Yes, there are two paths you can go by
            G
  But in the long run
  C             G                  Am
  There’s still time to change the road you’re on.
  D                Am    Em D C D
  Ooh, it makes me wonder

  C            G              Am
  Your head is humming and it won’t go
          G
  In case you don’t know,
  C          G              Am
  The pipers calling you to join him,
  C          G                Am
  Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow,
          G
  And did you know
  C             G           Am              C G Am
  Your stairway lies on the whispering wind.

  Am        G                F   G \ Am
  And as we wind on down the road
              G               F   G \ Am
  Our shadows taller than our soul.
                G           F   G \ Am
  There walks a lady we all know
            G                        F   G \ Am
  Who shines white light and wants to show
          G                    F   G \ Am
  How everything still turns to gold.
            G           F   G \ Am
  And if you listen very hard
                G              F   G \ Am
  The tune will come to you at last.
              G              F  G \ Am
  When all are one and one is all
          G               F
  To be a rock and not to roll.

            F        G              Am
  And she’s buying a stairway to heaven.

  # Verse 1
  There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
  And she's buying a stairway to heaven
  When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
  With a word she can get what she came for
  Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven

  There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
  'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
  In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
  Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
  You know

  There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
  And my spirit is crying for leaving
  In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
  And the voices of those who stand looking
  That's you

  And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune
  Then the piper will lead us to reason
  And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
  And the forests will echo with laughter
  Remember laughter?

  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah...

  And it makes me wonder
  If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
  It's just a spring clean for the May queen
  Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
  There's still time to change the road you're on

  Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
  The piper's calling you to join him
  Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
  Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

  And as we wind on down the road
  Our shadows taller than our soul
  There walks a lady we all know
  Who shines white light and wants to show
  How everything still turns to gold

  And if you listen very hard
  The tune will come to you at last
  When all is one and one is all, that's what it is
  To be a rock and not to roll, oh yeah
  And she's buying a stairway to heaven
